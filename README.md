 Automate machine learning .


Auto ML COEX is a Streamlit web application that helps you perform Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) on your dataset. It allows you to upload a CSV dataset, explore the data, run AutoML to find the best model, and visualize the model performance metrics.

Features
Upload Dataset: Upload your dataset in CSV format.
Data Exploration: Explore the uploaded dataset using D-Tale for data profiling.
Automated Machine Learning: Run AutoML using PyCaret to find the best model for your data.
Model Performance Visualization: Visualize the performance of different models in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Technologies Used
Streamlit: Web app framework for building the user interface.
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library.
PyCaret: Automated machine learning library for model training and selection.
D-Tale: Interactive data visualization tool for data profiling.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: Plotting libraries for data visualization.
